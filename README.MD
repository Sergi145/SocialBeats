# SOCIAL BEAT
SkyLab Coders Academy final Project November 2017.
Mostly coded in React as my aim it's to find myself confortable in front-end before working with backend.
I use axios to call the API from React.

## The Idea:

Is to engage young consummers of music events to volunteer in ONG's in exchange of a reduction 
in the price of the ticket entrace for each music event. Promoting volunteering and culture all at once.

   -Bootstrap
   
   
  -React
  
  
  -Node.js/Express
  
 
  -NPM
  
  
  -MongoDB
  
  
  -mLab
  
 ### To run the aplication:
 In console: 
 
 
  mongod( to run mongo)
  
  
  npm start ( for running react)
  
  
  node. (to run nodejs)
